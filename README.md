# Tony Young README

Welcome to my README of how I work best.

If you have any questions about this README, feel free to come and find me for a chat or Slack me

## Personal Info

I joined AND in September 2017 and am an Associate Product Developer AND Viking in squad Cypher.
I am a little over 2 years into my tech career having previously been a Fitness Manager and Personal Trainer.
I was born in Iceland (hence the AND title) but grew up in Cornwall.  
I love spending my free time with my son Jack and going on little adventures with him in the great outdoors.
I Love sports and if I am not playing golf, rugby, football, tennis, ping pong, pool (the list is endless!), then you will find me watching them with some beers and maybe friends!

## How do I work?

- I like to sleep in and need at least 7 - 8 hours of sleep.  That being said, ideally I would like to work from between 9:30/10:00 to 5:30/6:00.  This would be perfect as it would also mean you might miss rush hour on both ends of the day.  
- I must have some form of breakfast or I will be cranky!
- I like a morning espresso to perk me up a bit (just after stand up to start cracking on with work)
- I like to look at issues alone initially so that I feel I have full understanding before pairing with someone, or so that I can bring questions to the table to help clarify and give directions for a possible solution.
- I do like a regular break, once every one/two hours, ideally filled with ping pong or pool. This helps me go back to the desk with a fresh mind ready to continue.
- If I am really struggling I will ask for help... This is an area I need to work on as I can take longer than needed to reach out. (POINT THIS OUT TO ME IF YOU SEE ME DO THIS)
- If I look busy (headphones on etc), please don't hesitate to reach out to me.  If I can't help straight away I will let you know when I can.

## What makes me stressed out
- Pointless, overrun, poorly organised meetings.
- Lack of snacks
- Bad coffee

## Feedback

Feel free to give me any feedback that you might have.  If it happens to be negative feedback please try and give it to me in a constructive way or I will not listen.
Also, if you would like feedback for yourself, please do not hesitate to ask.

## HBDI

- I am Blue and Green dominant
- I like to solve problems logically.
- Organisation is important to me and I appreciate sticking to plans.
- I have strong verbal communication but can sometimes not speak up when I should.
- Under pressure my HBDI chart stays pretty much the same (Not sure if that is good or bad).

## Career aspirations
- Become a devops master
- Be language agnostic
- Work 2-3 days a week or 6 months out of the year and make sure I find a good work life balance
